In order to configure GRPC endpoints, a bp file needs to be saved in this directory.
Pb files are the binary versions of proto files, which are used in my .NET Core GrpcServices to define requests and responses.
<br>
<br>
In order to convert those proto files to the desired pb typed files, a Protocol Buffer Compiler is required. You can install it from one of the releases on this GitHub page [ProtocolBuffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).
Make sure you install a version compatible with your operating system and requirements. Once installed (actually, downloaded) unpack the compressed file to your desired location (e.g. Users/your-user/AppData/Local/unpacked-file) and add this directory to your SYSTEM_PATH.
<br>
<br>
Do this by following these steps:
1. Open file explorer.
2. Right click on "This PC".
3. Open properties.
4. Search for "Advanced system settings".
5. Open Environmental variables.
6. Look for the "PATH" variable in the "Systemvariables" section.
7. Click on it and press "edit".
8. Add a new row containing the path to your unpacked-file/bin folder (the one you just saved at your desired location, for example: C:\Users\your-user\AppData\Local\unpacked-file\bin).
- Just in case you use one of the "WellKnownTypes", I suggest adding a row for "unpacked-file/include" aswell.
9. Then just press "Ok" all the way back.
<br>
<br>
You are now able to use the "protoc" command within your system!
Now open a Terminal/Command Prompt where your csproj file is located (this part has not been tested outside of .NET Core applications) and ensure you have the following directories available:
<br>
<br>
proj
<br>
proj - Protos/*.proto
<br>
proj - google/api/*.proto  (only when using wellknowntypes)
<br>
proj - google/protobuf/*.proto  (only when using wellknowntypes)
<br>
<br>
You can now use the terminal/command prompt you opened and type the following command:
<br>
<br>
protoc --proto_path="." --proto_path="./Protos" --proto_path="your-absolute-path-to-csproj-dir\google\api" --descriptor_set_out="your-absolute-path-to-desired-storage-dir/file-name.pb" ./Protos/*.proto
<br>
<br>
Of course you have to replace the placeholders with your actuall paths!
